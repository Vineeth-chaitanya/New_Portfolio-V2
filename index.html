    <section id="about">
      <p style="max-width: 600px;">I'm a data scientist who enjoys turning ideas into tools people actually rely on. Most of 
        my work sits at the overlap of Machine Learning, Statistics and Large Language Models. I enjoy
        taking messy, real world data and turning it into systems that help people make better decisions.
      </p>
      <p style="max-width: 600px;">
        Currently, At <span class="accent">Pan American Health Organization</span> I am spending most of my time working on Large Language Models to help 
        build recommendation systems. I try to be a perfectionist even with my data, thoughtful engineering, meaningful
        evaluation, and experiments that tell you something real.
      </p>
      <p style="max-width: 600px;">
        Before fully moving into data science, I worked as a data analyst, which taught me how
        data flows through Organizations and why clarity and reliability matter just as much as accuracy.
        That background paired with my master's degree in information sciences shapes how I work today.
        I write readable code, ask practical questions, and try to build systems others can understand and maintain.
      </p>
      <p style="max-width: 600px;">
        Most days, I'm running, playing volleyball or finding some excuse to get a workout in. Staying still 
        has never been my strong suit.

        <p style="max-width: 620px;">At PAHO, I work across multilingual datasets and LLM-powered workflows to strengthen
          the journal's bibliometric and editorial intelligence. I design and operate LLM-powered
          NLP systems using models like Llama4:Scout and OpenAI text embedding models to classify
          research domains and generate article-similarity recommendations.
        </p>
        <p style="max-width: 620px;">
          A big part of my work is making these systems stable at scale token-aware batching,
          JSON repair, adaptive rate-limit handling and collaborating with editorial and bibliometric
          teams to unify datasets and support impact-factor initiatives.

        </h3>
        <p style="max-width: 620px;">At Thriving Elements, I worked across diverse participant profile data such as skills,
          goals, availability, engagement patterns to strengthen the matching logic behind a large scale mentor
          mentee program. I designed and operationalized a recommendation pipeline that combined TF-IFD vectorization, cosine similarity, and
          Sentence-BERT embeddings indexed through FAISS to surface pairings that were both contextually aligned and program relevant.
        </p>
        <p style="max-width: 620px;">
          A major part of my work involved engineering clean, structured features using Python and SQL, validating semantic relevance through precision@3 and NDCG, and 
          running controlled A/B tests to benchmark improvements over baseline heuristics. I collaborated closely with program managers
          to refine matching criteria, incorporate real world constraints, and integrate feedback loops that aligned the system with evolving 
          program needs. These efforts resulted in a more scalable, accurate and use centered matching experience
          that improved satisfaction and reduced operational overhead.

        <p style="max-width: 620px;">At Cognizant, I supported data ingestion, transformation, and validation workflows across
          SQL Server and Excel for financial services client. I optimized SQL queries, stored procedures,
          and reporting scripts to improve turnaround time and reliability. I also built Power BI
          dashboards that visualized KPIs and operational metrics, helping stakeholders make informed decisions.

            <p style="max-width: 620px;">
              Most promotions waste money by targeting customers who don't need an incentive or won't respond to one. This 
              Project uses Uplift modeling to pinpoint the customers whose behavior actually changes because of a promotional
              banner, allowing the business to maximize incremental conversions and minimize wasted spend.

          <p style="max-width: 620px;">
            Real world vaccine data is heavily biased, making it hard to know which allocation strategies actually work.
            This project builds a realistic simulation of California's rollout and uses causal off-policy evaluation
            to test alternative policies, revealing which strategies deliver the greatest reduction in population-level risk.
